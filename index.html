<p>The purpose of the project is to develop a system which controls a set of modeltrains by itself without using or just copying available systems. The only original parts will be the rails, the coils to control the switches, the power supply and of course the trains including the signal decoder. Everything else I will develop by myself. </p>

<a id="the-digital-signal" class="anchor" href="#the-digital-signal" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>The digital signal</h3>

<p>The used digital standard to pass the instructions to the trains is DCC (Digital Command Control) which modulates the voltage of the power supply. DCC standard regulates a bidirectional square-wave voltage. The length of the time the voltage is applied in each direction provides the method for encoding data.

To send a digital one, the half cycle of the signal is 58µs then it changes its voltage in the negative direction for another 58µs. The digital zero takes a half cycles at least nearly twice as long. As mentioned the train already includes a decoder. So the only need is to encode the signal. </p>
